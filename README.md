A replica of the famous Pac-Man arcade game. A single-player option is available, but the focus of this project was to show off the various search and game algorithms. Depending on the puzzle at hand, Pacman can use BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy, or A* search if it's a searching problem. Or he can use minimax, expectimax, or depth-limited search if facing an adversarial.
